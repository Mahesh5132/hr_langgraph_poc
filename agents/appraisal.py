''' 3. Appraisal Agent â€“ Industry-Ready Goals
Upgrade to:

âœ… Send reminders before appraisal cycles

âœ… Provide employee past performance summaries

âœ… Collect feedback or self-evaluation

âœ… Auto-notify manager or HR

Suggested Roadmap:
Trigger Dates Based on Department/Role

Pre-fetch last year performance summary (mock)

Prompt user to fill self-evaluation

Notify HR/manager with context

Log Appraisal Progress

Great â€” to refine the Appraisal Agent to an industry-level design, hereâ€™s a structured plan with logic and implementation in mind:

âœ… Assumptions
Annual appraisal is recorded in Workday.

We have access to Workday API (or can mock it for now).

Employee and manager details are stored in a MySQL DB.

Agent is expected to:

Notify employees about appraisal timelines.

Remind managers to complete feedback.

Fetch appraisal status for a user on request.

ðŸ§  Functional Requirements
Feature	Status
Appraisal timeline reminder (to employee)	âœ…
Manager feedback reminder	âœ…
Status fetch from Workday API	âœ…
Integration with LangGraph node	âœ…
Optional: Email or chatbot-based alerts	âœ…
